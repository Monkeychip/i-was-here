## I Was Here
This is a practice Github repository for readers of the "How to Become a Web Developer: a field guide" book.  This repository is used in the Git and Version Control Chapter.  

In this repository, I am asking readers to Fork, Clone, add their name to the "sign-your-name.md" file and then make a Pull Request to add their name to the repository. 

## Motivation
Practicing the concepts learned in the Git and Version Control Chapter.

## Code style
Just add your name as a new bullet point.  If don't want to use your real name that's fine, but at least make it creative.  No John Smiths allowed.  Think more "Slim Pickens" or "Zsa Zsa Gabor".

Append your name to the end of the file, after the most recent bullet point.

If you'd like to add a message, feel free.  Appropriate messages only please.

## How?

These are the same directions described in the book.

1. Fork the repository onto you Github account.
2. Clone the Forked repository on your computer.
3. Make a side-branch.
`git checkout -b some-branch-name`
3. Open the `sign-your-name.md` and add your name with a message (optional), just like Ryan Reynolds has. 
4. Push the changes to your Fork. Replace `Monkeychip` with your Github username, and `some-branch-name` with your branch's name.
`git push -u Monkeychip some-branch-name` 
5. Open a Pull request.  Ask to merge your `some-branch-name` into my master branch.  Give a brief description.
6. You'll be notified if I accept the changes and merge your changes, effectively adding your name to the list.
